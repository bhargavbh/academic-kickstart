# Biography

I am a Ph.D student supervised by <a href="http://bugcounting.net">  Prof. Carlo A Furia </a> at the <a href="http://si.usi.ch"> Software Institute</a>, USI Lugano. Previously, i was a Doctoral Research Assistant at the <a href="http://si.usi.ch"> Institute for Information Security, ETH Zurich </a> from 2015-2018. Before that, i completed Integrated Bachelors and Master in Mathematics and Computing at <a href="http://iitk.ac.in"> IIT Kanpur</a> in 2015, where my Masters Thesis was advised by <a href="http://home.iitk.ac.in/~mohua/"> Prof. Mohua Banerjee </a>.</p>
<p> I work currently on topics in formal verification with focus on program synthesis and automated program repair.
I also work on projects aiming to solve scalability issues for runtime monitoring on large and high velocity data traces, and explanation of counterexamples generated by model checkers.</p>
