# Biography

I am a third year Ph.D student in the <a href="http://infsec.ethz.ch"> Information Security Group</a> at ETH Zurich, advised by Prof. David Basin. Previously, i completed Integrated Bachelors and Master in Mathematics and Computing at <a href="http://iitk.ac.in"> IIT Kanpur</a> advised by <a href="http://home.iitk.ac.in/~mohua/"> Prof. Mohua Banerjee </a> in 2015. </p>
<p> My work on topics in formal verification with focus on runtime monitoring and model-checking.
My current research projects focus on issues regarding scalability of runtime monitoring on large and high velocity data traces, and explanation of counterexamples generated by LTL model checkers.</p>
